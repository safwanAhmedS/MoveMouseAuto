You can simply run the python code
Its gonna ask from options to either start recording, stop recording, perform the tasks and quit
Click on start recording and do whatever task you want to perform via mouse clicks, movement and keyboard clicks
It logs everything
Once done, come back to the running code and type in the command to stop the recording
Now, the recording is saved to the model and once you click to perform that task
Automatically whatever was recorded will now be performed and you can sit back and relax
Just see how the model automatically performs the task you once made it record, performing on it's own
Happy Coding :)
